        The Rough idea: A machine or box or bot that can be placed in varied environments, where it will collect data. <br> 
        These will be further processed and fed back to the bot so that it can take some decisions on its own<br><br></p>
        Topics I have realised I need to cover, so far: <br><br>
        Signal processing<br>
        Multiple communication<br>
        Power Source <br><br>

        There are small little nuances that can act as big roadblocks. Like I realised today, that connecting the battery power supply to the Arduino in opposite polarity won't work. <br>
        <p>
I had spent a lot of time in setting up the LM317 linear voltage regulator circuit. I have a power supply of 11.1 V and I wanted to step it down to 5 V to power the board as well as the sensors. From the formula Vo = Vref(1+ r2/r1), r1 = 330 and r2 = 990 for 5V. but with this configuration the power led of the board was barely on, so adding a 330 resistor in series and increasing r2 to 1330 increased the Vo to the board but this also increases the voltage difference to the sensors. 
I realised that signal from even ordinary sensors could be filtered and cleaned and insights could be obtained,  from this  Arduino Project : <a href="https://projecthub.arduino.cc/Johan_Ha/from-ky-039-to-heart-rate-8c660b#section6">Link</a>

            An observation: <br>
            <img src="./images/circuit1.jpg" alt="circuit"><br>
            The circuit<br>
            The linear hall magnetic sensor sets the output voltage to Vs/2 for 0 Gauss magnetic field and the output varies linearly. (from datasheet of 49E)<br>
            The supply voltage to the sensors was 6.29 V and the output of the hall magnetic sensor is set by this voltage. But the operating voltage of the arduino is 5V so it maps the voltage in 0 - 1023 based on this scale. <br>
            For every 4.9 mV, the analogRead increases by 1. <br>
            Mode ( most frequent value) = 409. This means 409x5/1023 = 2V was measured. This is less than half of 6.29 V, meaning some magnetic field is present. Which might be noise<br>
            At 6.29 V, sensitivity per volt is around 0.27 mV/G/ volt.<br><img src="./images/Screenshot 2025-01-27 213504.png" alt="image"> <br>So, 0.27 x 6.29 = 1.7mV/G<br> <img src="./images/Screenshot 2025-01-27 213345.png "><br> From the graph it is 1.5mV/G.<br> 6.29/2 = 3.145 V.<br> 3.145-2 = 1.145 V = 1145 mV<br>
            1145/ 1.7 G = 673.5 G <br>
            Cleared the sound analog reading by discarding all values less than mean.<br> The data is skewed so z-score, or quartile is not very useful.<br>
            Moving average filter to smoothen out the curve. Don't know if it is needed.

            Observation and calculations:<br>
            Lesser the light on the photo resistor??, more is the resistance. <br>
            In case of no external V+, 
            No much difference from the value of around 380, whether light is off or led is blocked by black cloth<br>Sensitivity is low<br>
            Connection of the v+ makes the reading stable and decreases the noise. <br>
            When A5 analog Input is configured as input pullup, the reading of the pin is given by VR1/ (R + R1) <br>
            <img src="./images/circuit2.jpg" alt="image"><br>
            Thus the reading increases as R1 increases.<br> The more light falling on the device, the value decreases, indicating a decrease in resistance. <br>
            Thus the light receiver may be a photodiode.

            Calibrating the KY-039 (Photodiode and LED)<br>
            Under 5V operation<br>
            Under 3.7V external<br>
            Reading decreases as light intensity increases, or when the diode is covered.
